# CNN_Image_Classification
Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into multiple categories. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout to prevent overfitting. Through training, the model improves its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall on the validation dataset.
